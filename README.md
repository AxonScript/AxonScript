## AxonScript

Hi, I'm Astral!

**AxonScript** is my own programming language.  
The original idea behind AxonScript was to create a language where you could easily build your own neural network.

At the moment, **native support for neural networks is not implemented yet**:

**Build #0001 ‚Äî Pre-Alpha Demo**

But even now, **AxonScript is already Turing complete!**

## Tools I used to build AxonScript

- **Rust** ‚Äî The entire language is written in Rust.
- **Logos** ‚Äî A Rust library for fast and efficient lexical analysis.
- **llvm-sys** ‚Äî A Rust binding for generating LLVM IR.
- **LLVM** ‚Äî A powerful toolkit for building compilers.

## Compilation process

### 1. Lexical Analysis  
First, your source code goes through lexical analysis. All the words in your code are broken down into **tokens**.

### 2. Parsing  
After tokenization, the code is transformed into an **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**.

### 3. Semantic Analysis  
The AST is checked for semantic correctness and then optimized. In this stage, the AST is transformed into **HIR (High-level Intermediate Representation)**.

### 4. IR Generation  
From the HIR, the compiler generates **LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation)**.

### 5. Compilation  
LLVM IR is then optimized and compiled into machine code.
